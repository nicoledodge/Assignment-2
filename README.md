### Portfolio Demo
![Category Demo](https://github.com/nicoledodge/Portfolio-Page/blob/main/assets/images/portfolio%20demo.gif?raw=true)

Created a Portfolio page based on past portfolio work with links to my personal website and portfolio.

Navigation bar list items are linked and will take the user directly to that section of the webpage.

Contact Me list items are linked to appropriate webpages. (excluding personal phone number & email)

Responsive layout makes it easy to view on mobile and different desktop sizes, with flex wrap properties on portfolio section to help stack images instead of list in line.

Each segment in contact me section uses animated css hover features, as well as the images in the portfolio section.

Added a footer at the end with a link to my website for further reference.
